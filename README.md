# 🌐 Flux Website — Because MVPs Deserve a Hype Page Too

Welcome to the official website of **Flux** — the app that’s trying to fix your finances while still trying to find investors. This site was made to look cool, sound clever, and make you believe we're just *one pitch away* from being the next big thing.

## 🚀 What's This Website About?

Think of it as our **digital elevator pitch**, but with scroll animations, sarcastic text bubbles, and a tiny bit of self-awareness. It tells you:

- 📱 What Flux is (spoiler: it tracks savings, expenses, goals, etc.)
- 🧠 That we have a “SmartAI” (quotes because it’s currently a glorified chatbot for investment FAQs)
- 📦 The *4-easy-step* user flow (add salary, add expenses, cry, invest)
- 🧊 Our cold but brutally honest MVP disclaimer section
- 💬 Even a fake text conversation between you and someone questioning the app’s worth (rude, but funny)

## 🖼️ Sections You'll See

1. **Hero Section** – Clean. Punchy. Pretending we’re funded.
2. **Bento Grid of Features** – Because grids = legit.
3. **SmartAI Intro** – Reads like a product tease. Works like a baby calculator.
4. **4-Step User Flow** – For people who love visuals and short attention spans.
5. **Sassy MVP Disclaimer** – Yes, we’re self-aware.
6. **Fake Text Chat** – Because sarcasm sells.
7. **Footer** – Minimal, neat, slightly self-deprecating.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **React + Vite** – Because speed matters when you don’t have features.
- **Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui** – Because UI should slap even if the backend doesn’t.
- **Framer Motion** – For smooth animations and cooler-than-it-should-be buttons.
