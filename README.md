# Admin Panel Assignment

This project is a professional replica of the given admin panel, created as part of an assignment.

## Objective

The goal was to replicate the design and functionality of the provided admin panel, ensuring a responsive and clean user interface.

## Approach

As I have an important college project review scheduled for the 23rd and 24th, I prioritized completing the UI and responsiveness first, as per the instructions given. I aimed to mirror the layout and interactions accurately while maintaining clean and scalable code.

Despite the time constraints, I have implemented as many core functionalities as possible within the given timeline.
