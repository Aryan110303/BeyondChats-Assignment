# 💸 SmartSave — Because Your Wallet Deserves Better

So… you spend half your salary on food delivery, don’t know where the other half went, and your idea of savings is *"whatever’s left by the 25th"*?  
Same. That’s why **SmartSave** exists.  
Well, *sort of*. It’s just an MVP right now — but hey, big things have humble beginnings (and zero funding).

## 🧠 What is SmartSave?

**SmartSave** is your passive-aggressive best friend for managing your finances.  
It helps you:

- 💰 **Track your income** (like that once-in-a-blue-moon salary drop)
- 💸 **Record your expenses** (yes, even that ₹300 coffee)
- 📈 **See your savings** (surprise: it’s not zero)
- 📚 **Explore beginner-friendly investment options** (no jargon, just vibes)
- 🤖 **Use SmartAI** to get finance tips and strategies (still learning, but smarter than your friend who invested in Dogecoin)
- 📲 (Coming Soon-ish): **Make UPI payments directly**, and automatically track them. Because typing "coffee - ₹300" 17 times a week is *not* it.

## ⚙️ How It Works — In 4 Steps

1. **Add your Salary** – Manifest the money.
2. **Add your Expenses** – Be honest, we know you bought that 8th tote bag.
3. **Get your Savings** – Math happens. Magic.
4. **View Investment Options** – So your money can grow while you binge Netflix.

## 🤡 But Wait, Is This It?

Yes, Sherlock. It’s an MVP.  
If you want real features like full automation, real-time syncing, bank linking, and AI that roasts your spending habits —  
**sponsor me or tell Jeff Bezos to call me**. Until then, this is what you get 💅.
